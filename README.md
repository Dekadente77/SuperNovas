# DystopianPunks V2

Welcome to a tech-filled dystopian future where only **2077 Punks** survived.

**DystopianPunks V2** are a mix between generative and handmade **NFTs**. They are the continuation and total improvement of the **[DystopianPunks V1](https://opensea.io/collection/dystopianpunks)**, designed to build a **Punkverse**.

**V1** holders will receive an exclusive **Airdrop** of the 100 **Animated Cyborgs**, in other words if you have a **V1** you will receive your **Punks** turned into cyborgs completely free even without paying gas fees.

## Claim free Punks

## Difference of DystoPunks V2

**[DystoPunks V1](https://opensea.io/collection/dystopianpunks)** was one of the first **[Unofficial Punks](https://unofficialpunks.com)**, they are a 100% handmade experimental project, which turned out to be a success, only 100 exist and yet there is a great community around them.

**DystoPunks V2** were created for various reasons; To take dystopians to the next level and generate further growth of the dysto community, enhance the rarity system with many improved and better distributed futuristic tech accessories, develop a **Punkverse** where the community can interact through their **Punks**, and of course reward all those who have supported the project since the beginning.

**V2** are similar to **V1** as they maintain the same **Cyberpunk** concept and the same color palette but several accessories have been added and improved **(52 traits)** as well as a new **Punk Type: Robots**, however the **V1** will maintain unique aspects that will not exist in **V2** such as certain combinations, colorful beards and some traits.

This project pays homage to the original **CryptoPunks** and is not affiliated with **Larva Labs**.
